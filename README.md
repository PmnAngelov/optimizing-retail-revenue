# Optimizing Retail Revenue Using SQL 
This notebook contains the use of SQL in order to analyze product data for an online sports retail company and provide valuable insights for business optimization.

## Project Overview

The SQL analysis involves querying the database to answer multiple business questions such as:
* How do the price points of different products differ?
* Do discounted products influence revenue? 
* How strong is the correlation between discount and revenue?
* How important is the product's description length?
* What kind of products are the most profitable?

This analysis will work with different types of data and use the following techniques to answer the business questions and produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue:
* Data Cleaning
* Aggregations
* Labeling 
* Common Table Expressions 
* Correlation analysis

## Conclusion

The insights gained from the SQL analysis are used to provide recommendations for optimizing revenue. For example, the analysis may reveal that certain products are selling well and should be given more prominent placement in stores or online.
