# Optimizing Retail Revenue Using SQL - Personal Project
This notebook contains the use of SQL in order to analyze product data for an online sports retail company.

This analysis will work with numeric, string, and timestamp data on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic. 

The exploratory analysis also uses techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue.
